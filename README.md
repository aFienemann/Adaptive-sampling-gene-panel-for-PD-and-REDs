# Adaptive-sampling-gene-panel-for-PD-and-REDs

In our study, "Innovative Gene Panel for Parkinson's and Repeat Expansion Disorders Using Long-Read Adaptive Sampling", we designed a gene panel comprising 565 loci associated with PD, repeat expansion disorders, and other neurodegenerative and movement disorders. We used ONT long-read sequencing with adaptive sampling to perform targeted sequencing of the panel and investigate its diagnostic utility.
This repository contains scripts for variant calling of SNVs, SVs, and repeat expansions.
For the analysis of repeat expansions, the software NCRF (https://github.com/makovalab-psu/NoiseCancellingRepeatFinder) was used.
