# Adaptive-sampling-gene-panel-for-PD-and-REDs

In our study, "Innovative Gene Panel for Parkinson's and Repeat Expansion Disorders Using Long-Read Adaptive Sampling", we designed a gene panel comprising 565 loci associated with PD, repeat expansion disorders, and other neurodegenerative and movement disorders. We used ONT long-read sequencing with adaptive sampling to perform targeted sequencing of the panel and investigate its diagnostic utility.

This repository contains the input BED file used for adaptive sampling, along with scripts and references for analyzing repeat expansions using the NCRF software (https://github.com/makovalab-psu/NoiseCancellingRepeatFinder).

In addition, the mapped CRAM files of all 15 positive controls with known pathogenic variants used in this study were deposited as a resource in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) at EMBL-EBI under accession number PRJEB105200 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB105200).
